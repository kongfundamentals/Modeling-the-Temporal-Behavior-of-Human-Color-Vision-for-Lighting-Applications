# What is this GitHub repository for, and why didn't I choose for an institutional repository?
First of all, I cannot change anything after the thesis book is published online, and I hope that I can use this space to still maintain and make update my thesis in some way. An institutional repository is great but it usually requires the institutional email address to access it. GitHub provides a great flexiblity and full control, which I like.

The other strong motivation is that - I have spent 6 years (September 2015 - July 2021) on my Ph.D. project, and I have learnt so much from it: "the Good, the Bad and the Ugly." I want to have use space to share my knowledge, my experience, and the lessons that I learnt. I hope someone can benefit from it. 

The GitHub repo for archiving the data, codes, and updates for my Ph.D. project and dissertation "Modeling the Temporal Behavior of Human Color Vision for Lighting Applications".

For any questions regarding the repo, or discussions with the topic of my research, please address the correspondences at <kongfundamentals@gmail.com>.
